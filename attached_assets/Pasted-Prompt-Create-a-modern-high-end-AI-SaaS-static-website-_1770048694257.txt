Prompt:

Create a modern, high-end AI SaaS static website for a product named Trackademiq.

Tagline:
“Next-Generation Education Systems”

Purpose

This is a marketing/landing website only, not an application UI and not an ERP dashboard.
The website must visually and textually communicate that Trackademiq is an AI-powered education intelligence platform, not a simple school management system.
