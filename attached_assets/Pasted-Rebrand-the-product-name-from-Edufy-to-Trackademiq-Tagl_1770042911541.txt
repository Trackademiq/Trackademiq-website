Rebrand the product name from Edufy to Trackademiq.
Tagline: “Next-Generation Education Systems.”

Design a powerful, modern, AI-driven education analytics platform website — not a simple school website and not a traditional ERP-looking system.
The product must visually and functionally communicate that it is an intelligent, data-driven platform connecting Students, Teachers, Parents, and Administrators through real-time analytics and automation.
